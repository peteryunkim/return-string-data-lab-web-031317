# Returning Strings Lab



use AJAX to bring data to the page.

## Instructions




5. Add another route and action that checks if inventory is available.
   This route should return just `"true"` or `"false"` as strings.
6. Add a "More Info" button to each product that, when clicked, fetches
   the description and the inventory and displays the result. If there
is inventory available, display "Available" and if there isn't, display
"Sold Out".
7. Make sure tests pass!

**Note:** You will need to have [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed for the feature specs, which use the [selenium-webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/rb) gem to test pages with JavaScript requirements.
